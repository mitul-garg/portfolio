## Follow these steps, to make this portfolio your own,

- Then, open the folder in your favourite IDE (I prefer [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) and run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

- Now, you can edit the files present in the **data** folder in **src**
- You may also want to change some external links in **Blogs.js** file in the _"All Blogs"_ button
